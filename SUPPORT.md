## Support

For most part I do open-source contributions and packages for [fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/). However if what I have created has provided value and you want show appreciation, here's what you can do:

Costs you time:
- Consider starring the repository
- Write a thank you email to `thanks[at]ncla[dot]me`

Costs you money:
- Buy me Discord Nitro (10 USD), my username is `ncla#1337` (User ID: `192244834281586688`)
- Subscribe to [Protonmail](https://pr.tn/ref/3X7NGNSPBDPG), a privacy first email service (I get signup credits)
- Donate to [EFF](https://www.eff.org/)
